### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am new to GitHub and currently working with it for classes in my pursuit of my Bachelor's in Computer Science.

Currently, I am taking Algorithms and Functional Programming, using JavaScript and SCALA for the first time in each class, respectively.

I have used a variety of other programming languages to varying degrees of detail, including Visual Basic, Python, and C++.
